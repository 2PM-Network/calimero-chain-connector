# 2PM-chain-connector

Chain Connector is an abstract layer connecting 2PM Node and the Blockchain. Chain Connector provides a unique set of APIs to Delta Node regardless of the type of Blockchain system used. And Chain Connector handles the Blockchain transaction signing. In a strict security environment, Chain Connector supports using an isolated signer to keep the private key offline and submit the signature remotely, thus keeping the private key safe.
